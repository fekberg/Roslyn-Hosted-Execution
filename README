Rossie is a project that will allow you to run code snippets in a secure sandbox with very low trust level and get a result back.

The system uses the latest version of Roslyn from Microsoft ( http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27746 ).

This is an example of how Rossie works:

1. Start the Rossie Engine Service
2. Connect to it with the Demo application
3. Run the following code snippet: return BitConverter.ToString(System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetBytes("me@home"));
4. See the following result: "6D-65-40-68-6F-6D-65"

This is not a standard REPL and Rossie does not keep any state.
